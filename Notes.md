# Go
- It is not an object oriented language.

# Conventions 
- Use of `this` or `self` is not a good practice. It is technically correct though.

# New Leanings 
- Variable declaration outside of function is ok but definition is not.
- It is required to be all the defined variables. If a variable has to be defined but won't be used then used `_` to avoid the compilation error.
